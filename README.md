# ML
In this project I build a simple Natural language processing application with Flask and TextBlob.
I embed NLP into Flask and use it to analyze a given text for important relevant points(summary) and  for sentiment analysis.
One of the most advantage of this project  Understanding Everyday Language.
One of the feature is that ,it links the relevant point to Dictionary.com where you come to know exact meaning as well synonyms for better understanding of words.
